# activeCollab integration for todo.txt

This is a simple plugin that provides [todo.txt](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli) integration with the [activeCollab](http://activecollab.com) project/ticket structure.

## Setup

- Copy `ac` into your scripts directory
- Edit `tasks.cfg` and add:
	- `export AC_URL="https://your_active_collab_url"`
	- Make sure there is no trailing slash for your URLÏ€

## Usage

- `task add DESCRIPTION ac:{project_number}/{ticket_number}
	- Ticket number is optional.

- `task ac {task_number`
	- If {task_number} has an AC URL referenced, it will open in your web browser.
